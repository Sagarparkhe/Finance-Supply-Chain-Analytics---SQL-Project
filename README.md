# Finance-Supply-Chain-Analytics--SQL Project

This project was completed as part of the **CodeBasics Data Analyst Bootcamp 2.0**, where I applied **MySQL** to analyze and optimize the financial and supply chain operations of **AtliQ Hardware**, a global electronics manufacturing company. The primary objective was to address performance challenges and extract key business insights from a growing dataset.

# 📁 Project Overview
AtliQ Hardware, a leading player in the manufacturing of PCs, printers, and computer peripherals, faced operational inefficiencies due to increasing data size and complexity. Using **MySQL**, I developed optimized queries that enhanced performance and provided actionable insights.

# 🎯 Project Goal

The goal was to use SQL to solve the performance issues and to extract insights that could improve decision-making processes in finance and supply chain management.

# 📊 Key Reports Generated

**Croma India Sales Report:** Detailed analysis of sales performance in India.

**Croma Yearly Gross Sales Report:** Year-over-year sales trends across different regions.

**Top 5 Markets by Net Sales:** Identifying the highest-performing markets.

**Top 5 Customers by Net Sales:** Highlighting the most valuable customers.

**Top 5 Products by Net Sales:** Revealing the best-selling products.

**Net Sales % Report by Region:** Analyzing customer sales percentages across different regions.

**Market Share % Analysis:** Market share breakdown for specific regions and customers.

# ⚙️ Query Optimization

The dataset consisted of over 1.5 million records, necessitating the use of efficient SQL queries. Key techniques employed included:

Joins: Optimized to reduce query execution time.

Aggregations: Used to summarize large datasets effectively.

Window Functions: Applied to calculate running totals, rankings, and other key metrics.

These optimizations significantly improved performance, reducing query execution times compared to the previously used Excel-based approach.
